# Tensorflow 2.0 Documentation Report

The documentation is a creating a deeper understanding of **tensorflow 2.0** by reading, writing and using the code. Many known and usefule functions are now different in tensorflow 2.0. The best way to start the journey again is to document and report the following discoveries. The document or our document is not going to be a documentation of everything. The documentation will be based on discoveries, meaning problem solving type of document, where I find certain problem or dead-end, then find light through research and discovery.  

## tf.GradientTape

Records the operation for automatic differentiation. It is the best of use when we use gradient descent operations on the code.

## tf.group

Create an operation that groups multiple operations.
