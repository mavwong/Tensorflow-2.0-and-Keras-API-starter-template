# Tensorflow-2.0-and-Keras

## Project Detail

The notebook is a guideline for the author for upcoming projects. The main takeaway here is it uses the latest `tensorflow` high level api and dataset to understand artificial neural network, convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network, hence `deep learning.`  

## Getting Started:

### Installation:

Download the repository of the project. Install `anaconda` environment into your local system or use `google colab`. For the following project, I mainly used colab. To install tensorflow 2.0 in colab: 

> !pip install -q tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0
